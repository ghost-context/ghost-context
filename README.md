Ghost Context is a wallet-based discovery app. Our app helps users run analysis on NFTs held by any wallet address to summon a weighted list of kindred spirits based on the frequency of commonly held NFTs based on source-wallet collections.

## 🦇 Signal

The app analyzes NFTs (ERC-721/ERC-1155), POAPs, and ERC-20 tokens across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base using Alchemy, POAP, and Moralis APIs. Farcaster social data is integrated via Neynar and Airstack.

Why is surfacing ghost context infinitely interesting?

- It’s a cheat code unique to web3 for finding your connections on the red thread of fate.
- Ghosties—previously invisible kindred collectors, now made visible through surfaced ghost context—have a high likelihood of being up to interesting stuff or curating high-affinity stuff that satisfies your thumbprint of curiosity.
- Getting your Ghostie Row (top kindred spirits) on your radar is destined to unveil pathways of inspiration in the future.
- Surfacing ghost context produces inexorable resonance across web3.

If none of the above proves true…yet, the latent possibility of meeting the minds in your Ghostie Row and experiencing hyperconnection might manifest something meaningful, like the phenomena of generating scenius, birthing a hyperculture, or contributing to chaos magic.

Your Ghostie Row may be the key to leveling up your own neuroplasticity and output, as these kindred collectors are motivated to act as force multipliers on your most meaningful work.

## Roadmap

- ~~Integrate Web3 social handles into results (Farcaster)~~ ✅
- ~~Add Base, Optimism, and Polygon chains~~ ✅
- ~~Implement cross-chain NFT analysis~~ ✅
- Organize NFTs by transfer time
- Integrate Lens social handles
- Integrate XMTP into results
- Add Zora chain
- Facilitate wallet to wallet connections via double opt-in logic
- Deploy ability to run analysis with "OR" Boolean Operators
- Notifications

## Current Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- WalletConnect (Web3Modal) and Wagmi
- Alchemy SDK (multi-chain NFTs)
- Moralis API (ERC-20 tokens)
- POAP API
- Neynar / Airstack (Farcaster)

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.x and npm
- An Ethereum wallet like MetaMask for interacting with the dApp
- API keys: Alchemy, Moralis, POAP, Neynar, Airstack (see CLAUDE.md for full list)
